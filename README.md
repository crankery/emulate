Emulate is an 8 bit CPU emulation library written entirely in managed c#. The first CPUs to be emulated are the Intel 8080 and MOS 6502. I have a vague plan of doing the Z80 and 6809 at some point.

I tried to chose straightforward implementation over efficiency. If you want an efficient emulation there's loads of really good implementations. :)

The Console project is a start at emulating the IMSAI 8800. It isn't complete but will run various flavours of basic.

I've tried to give credit to the others who figured out the tricky details in code comments.
